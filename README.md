# Human as Points: Explicit Point-based 3D Human Reconstruction from Single-view RGB Images
Tang Yingzhi, Zhang Qijian, Hou Junhui, Liu Yebin

The official pytorch implementation of HaP.

## CODE
HaP is a single-view human reconstruction framework, it has four modules:
1. Depth Estimation
2. SMPL Estimation and Rectification
3. Point Cloud Generation
4. Depth Replacement

**To train and test HaP, you need to prepare the training data first. Please refer to [2K2K](https://github.com/SangHunHan92/2K2K) or [IntegratedPIFu](https://github.com/kcyt/IntegratedPIFu)**
Both [2K2K](https://github.com/SangHunHan92/2K2K) and [IntegratedPIFu](https://github.com/kcyt/IntegratedPIFu) provide detailed rendering script to prepare the RGB images and depth maps. Additional, [IntegratedPIFu](https://github.com/kcyt/IntegratedPIFu) also provides the blender project to prepare the normal map. 

For each module, I provide a folder to run the code. 

In the **generatemesh** folder, we provide an "in-the-wild" image example, you can run the script to see example generated meshes. 

We sincerely thank the authors of [ICON](https://github.com/YuliangXiu/ICON), [2K2K](https://github.com/SangHunHan92/2K2K),  [IntegratedPIFu](https://github.com/kcyt/IntegratedPIFu), [PDR](https://github.com/ZhaoyangLyu/Point_Diffusion_Refinement), [EcoDepth](https://github.com/aradhye2002/ecodepth) and [MIM-Depth-Estimation](https://github.com/SwinTransformer/MIM-Depth-Estimation) for their excellent work and the released code.
